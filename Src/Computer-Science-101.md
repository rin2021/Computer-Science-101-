# Stanford CS101 

This is a self-paced introductory course to Computer Ccience by Nick Parlante - Stanford University. It introduces a complete beginner to the subject by taking them through the basic ideas of how computers works - the nature of computer, what it can and can't do, code, hardware, security, analog vs digital, memory, and other coputer concepts and jargons.

**Note:** 
* Keep in mind that this course uses **JavaScript** for exercises.

## What is a string?
In computer science a string is **a series of letters**. In JavaScript, a string is written within double quotes:
```javascript
print("This is a string."); 
```
It will print (display): `This is a string.`

**Strings and numbers are the two most common data types in computer code.**

Commenets are written to make notes for yourself (the programmer) within the code. The computer will ignore them when you run the code.
Again in JavaScript, comment are written using two forward slashes.
```javascripts
\\This is a comment and the computer will ignore when you run your code
```
## Syntax error 
Everyone runs into a syntax error. It basically means that the computer does not understand your command because you made a mistake in typing the syntaxes. For the most part, the error messages are straight forward and clear, but they can be subtle too. But nothing to be ashamed; it happens to everyone.
