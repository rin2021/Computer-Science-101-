# Welcome to Stanford CS101
This is a self-paced course. The outline below on this page lists all the lectures and exercises organized as Week-1, Week-2 to Week-6.

**Note:** 
* Keep in mind that this course uses **JavaScript** for exercises.

## What is a string?
In computer science a string is **a series of letters**. In JavaScript, a string is written within double quotes:
```javascript
print("This is a string."); 
```
It will print (display): `This is a string.`

**Strings and numbers are the two most common data types in computer code.**

Commenets are written to make notes for yourself (the programmer) within the code. The computer will ignore them when you run the code.
Again in JavaScript, comment are written using two forward slashes.
```javascripts
\\This is a comment and the computer will ignore when you run your code
```
